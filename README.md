<h1 align="center">Full-Stack Software Developer</h1>

‚ÄúImagine who you could be, and then aim single-mindedly at that.‚Äù 

After reading Jordan Peterson‚Äôs closing remark in the second chapter of his book, Beyond Order, I turned off my Kindle and thought about the direction I was headed. I had been drifting: serving in restaurants, considered being a translator, a linguist‚ÄîI even tried out the nomadic lifestyle, traveling and teaching English. These paths, however, were either not satisfying or didn‚Äôt have a strong job market outlook. Luckily for me, three developers in my life saw potential for me to succeed at and enjoy programming. They all told me to give it a try, and upon completing my very first Python course on YouTube, I knew I had found my target to aim at.

While I‚Äôm moving away from education and restaurant service, I certainly do not regret my time in either. Teaching (and learning about teaching) has led me to become more adept at connecting new ideas to previous knowledge, which is paramount for internalizing unfamiliar concepts. As a server, I learned to anticipate customer needs and became a more proactive person‚Äîan element of growth that I attribute to my careful attention to detail and drive for consistent improvement.

As I transition into the world of software development, I am confident that my enthusiasm for solving logical problems, my disposition toward growth, detail, and efficiency, and lessons learned from previous experience will all propel me to reach my target of becoming an expert programmer. But, I recognize that I have much to learn, and I‚Äôm willing to put in the effort.

<!---

- I'm interested in both web development and software development, and I also have experience with _**Python**_.

- _There is great power in the idea of dividing a big problem into smaller problems, solving those problems, and then putting the solutions together to solve the big problem. Programming harnesses this power, and that's why it's so fascinating to me_.


- I have many interests outside of programming. 
  - I'm passionate about languages and linguistics. I've learned to speak Spanish as a second language. I studied a fair bit of German, and I've also dabbled in French, Portuguese, Italian, Swedish, and Quechua. I'm fascinated by the complexity of languages, their idiosyncracies, and how they interact with each other.
  - I'm also passionate about traveling. There are many lessons to be learned from spending time immersed in another culture. I've traveled across the United States, only missing the Northeast, Alaska, and Hawaii. I've spent time in Italy, Canada, Chile, Peru, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Mexico.
  - I enjoy being active. I like hiking, playing soccer, riding my longboard, going to the gym, and practicing yoga. I also enjoy reading, philosophy, chess, and Pok√©mon.
