# JavaScript and Python Developer
- My interests in web development lie in the back end, but I do have experience with React. I'm also interested in software development.
- Programming is fascinating to me because of its problem-solving process; there is great power in the idea of dividing a big problem into many smaller problems, solving those smaller problems, and putting those solutions together to solve the big problem.

- I have many interests outside of programming. 
  - I'm passionate about languages and linguistics. I've learned to speak Spanish as a second language. I studied a fair bit of German, and I've also dabbled in French, Portuguese, Italian, Swedish, and Quechua. I'm fascinated by the complexity of languages, their idiosyncracies, and how they interact with each other.
  - I'm also passionate about traveling. There are many lessons to be learned from spending time immersed in another culture. I've traveled across the United States, only missing the Northeast, Alaska, and Hawaii. I've spent time in Italy, Canada, Chile, Peru, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Mexico.
  - I enjoy being active. I like hiking, playing soccer, riding my longboard, going to the gym, and practicing yoga. I also enjoy reading, philosophy, chess, and Pokémon.
